### Goals
1. Make the tool feel like a natural device for playing accompaniment to an existing song

## Progress
Playable using right and left hands
The interface: you send messages to the device by touching your fingers to your thumb. Left hand controls chord played, right hand can modify the chord
(Pinky does nothing for now)
