### Goals
1. Make it feel like a natural device for playing accompaniment to an existing song
2. Make it useful for original songwriting

## Progress
Playable using right and left hands
(Phone should be on its right side, locked in portrait orientation)
Interface: you send messages to the device by touching your fingers to your thumb. Left hand controls chord played, right hand can modify the chord
(Pinky does nothing for now)
